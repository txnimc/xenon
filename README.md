# Xenon

Xenon is a fork of Embeddium (Forge port of the Sodium performance mod) with improvements, extra options, and new maintainers. 

Currently, it includes all the extra improvements from my Embeddium Extras mod, as well as Reese's vertical video settings (which is required for the extra options).

This mod is intended to be a replacement for Embeddium on 1.20.1 (and older versions soon) that is not hostile 
to upstream Sodium. 
* This mod will stay Forge only. 
* Contributions and improvements are welcome and accepted. 
* When/if Sodium releases an official Forge port for newer versions, this mod will stop being updated for those versions.

Xenon is **not supported by CaffeineMC, or embeddedt**. Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their
Discord. You can report issues on the [Xenon GitHub](https://github.com/anthxnymc/xenon) or on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/c6BBguCUWx).

## Compatibility

**OptiFine is not supported**. This mod replaces OptiFine.

Xenon will work with everything Embeddium does, as it is a fork. We intend to keep compatibility
with upstream and Embeddium / Forge Sodium addons as much as possible.

## Shaders

For now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.
If you encounter issues with shaders installed, disable Oculus first, and if that fixes it, report the issue to them instead.
